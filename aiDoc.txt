Detailed Documentation for Shallow Water Equation Solver Code
1. Overview
This Fortran program solves the Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) coupled with the suspended sediment transport equation. The solution updates bed elevation using Exner's equation. The program employs:

Finite Volume Methods for numerical solution.
Roe's Solver for flux calculation across cell faces.
MUSCL (Monotonic Upstream-centered Scheme for Conservation Laws) to achieve second-order accuracy.
Structured grids as the computational domain.
The code is capable of handling:

Sediment transport modeling with single or multiple grain sizes.
Explicit time-stepping schemes for stability.
2. Input Files
The program requires three input files:

Initial and Boundary Conditions File:

Provides initial values for water depth, velocity components, and sediment concentration.
Specifies boundary conditions for inflow, outflow, and walls.
File Format: Each file is structured with clear sections for relevant parameters, typically read using READ statements in Fortran.
