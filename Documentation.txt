INTRODUCTION

Purpose:
This code is solving the Shallow Water Equations coupled with suspended load equation.
After solving the flow field, the bed elevation is updated using Exner equation. Finite
Volume Method is used with Roe's solver to calculate the fluxes at the cell faces. MUSCL
scheme is used to extend the solution to second order accuracy. The code is made to work
on structured grid and the used schemes are explicit. For more than one grain size for 
the sediment, D50 must be used or the code must be modified.

INSTALLATION
------------------------------

Prerequisites:
The code is written in legacy Fortran. The user has to install any version of Fortran
to the computer first. For Windows users, it is highly recommended to install the 
program in Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for it to work properly.

Installation:
-In WSL, or Linux, navigate to the /SWE folder.
-Write "gfortran -std=legacy -o swe_solver swe_solver.f" in the terminal.
-This command will generate the "swe_solver" as an output.
-Then navigate to the case, the program comes with "Contraction", and "Dam" cases.
-In the case folder, writing "../SWE/swe_solver" will run the program.
